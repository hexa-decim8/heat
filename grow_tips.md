# Germination
Jiffy seed pods and Jiffy seed trays are effective in getting seeds to germination. Give the seeds a sunny spot 
(a sunny window works great) and let them get as much sunlight as possible. The most important thing for germination
is to make sure that the trays are kept warm. Once the seeds begin to sprout, they will need continuous sunlight.
