## Buyer Beware
If you want to grow superhots, be careful about buying seeds from inauthentic sources. There are some sellers who
will sell mystery seeds and claim that they are superhots. They tend to be cheaper, but you'll be disappointed by
what you end up getting when the plants are fully grown.  

## Know Before You Go
Look at a good climate map and figure out what "zone" you're in. Knowing what zone your in will help you make good
choices about what you'll need to do with your plants to best care for them. 

# Germination
Jiffy seed pods and Jiffy seed trays are effective in getting seeds to germination. Give the seeds a sunny spot 
(a sunny window works great) and let them get as much sunlight as possible. The most important thing for germination
is to make sure that the trays are kept warm. Once the seeds begin to sprout, they will need continuous sunlight.

Realistically, you shouldn't need to open up the trays much before the seedlings are ready to get re-potted.

## Labeling
Seed trays are also good for keeping track of what varieties you have planted. 

# First Sprout
Once the seeds begin to sprout, they'll have a few more needs right. Make sure the clear plastic top stays on the
top of the trays as much as possible. Peppers like sunlight and humidity, give them as much of both as you can.

It's important not to overewater the newly sprouted seeds. It'll be tempting to do this, but with the lid on, the
water stays in as a closed system.

Your first sprout should come with two starter leaves. These two leaves help separate the stem from the seed
casing and provide the first bit of photosynthesis for your beloved little death bringers. At a certain point,
these leaves give less and less to the baby pepper plant as new leaves come in.

Keep track of the leaf count in your plants so that you can track where their maturity is.
